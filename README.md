## Estimations
### API analysis 1 hour, 
### Project and Git Setup 1 hour, 
### Implement UI 8 hours, 
### Functionalities 2 hours

## Notes
### 1. Popular movie list api does not have any option to fetch with genre. For this I've filtered existing popular movie list with genre.  
### 2. In Production app the View Controllers folder will be refactored to Features. Under Features there will be folders for each feature of the app.
